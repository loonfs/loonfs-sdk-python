# LoonFS Python SDK

One package for LoonFS server and proxy applications. SDK v0.3.x targets LoonFS
API v0.3.x.

## Install

```sh
pip install loonfs
```

Choose the module that matches where your code runs.

## Server

```python
import os

from loonfs.server import LoonFS

client = LoonFS(
    base_url=os.environ["LOONFS_URL"],
    token=os.environ["LOONFS_AUTH_TOKEN"],
    actor_id="example-user",
)

capabilities = client.capabilities.retrieve()
commit = client.files.upload("demo", path="/hello.txt", content=b"hello")
print(commit.commit_id, commit.events)
```

Publishing helpers return the commit, including its events. Pass `commit_id`
explicitly if you may retry. Use
`request_options={"additional_headers": {"Loonfs-Actor": actor_id}}`
to override the client default for a request.

Use `client.files.download_stream` in a `with` block for bounded download memory:

```python
with client.files.download_stream("demo", path="/large.bin", request_options={"timeout": 60}) as download:
    for chunk in download:
        destination.write(chunk)
```

Successful exhaustion verifies both size and checksum. Leaving the block early
closes the response without claiming verification; bytes already consumed cannot
be recalled if a later check fails. The request's `timeout` (or the client default)
applies to metadata and payload HTTP I/O for direct and proxied reads. Python's
synchronous HTTPX timeout bounds I/O waits, not the time spent processing chunks.
Direct requests do not inherit API authorization, cookies or API headers, and
never follow redirects. Closing the stream or interrupting its `with` block is
the synchronous cancellation mechanism.

`client.files.download` collects the same verified stream into memory.
`client.files.upload` accepts in-memory bytes through the same transfer path.
Use `prepare_stream` to retain prepared content for publication retries:

```python
with open("large.bin", "rb") as source:
    prepared = client.files.prepare_stream(
        "demo", content=source, request_options={"timeout": 60}
    )
```

Pass `size_bytes` when known to validate the source and choose the usual transport.
Small files and streams are prepared inline when advertised, up to the smaller
of the server limit and 64 KiB. Preparation reads at most that limit plus one byte
before deciding; it preserves the prefix when continuing through an upload.
Larger unknown-size sources use multipart when available; memory is bounded by a
provider-sized part plus the lookahead prefix. `upload_stream` prepares and
publishes in one operation.
The HTTP I/O timeout applies to both transports. Source and payload failures abort
without replaying bytes. The caller owns the source and must interrupt any
blocking source read; an HTTP timeout cannot interrupt arbitrary Python code.

Preparation returns `PreparedFile`: either `InlinePreparedContent` (immutable
bytes, no upload or expiry) or the existing `PreparedContent` (uploaded reference
and token). Pass either to `upload_prepared`. If inspecting `content_ref` or
`content_token`, first check `isinstance(prepared, PreparedContent)`; those fields
exist only after an upload. Existing staged constructors remain supported.

`AsyncLoonFS` provides the same generated API and `files` helpers for async applications.

## Proxy

Use `loonfs.proxy` in your backend to forward client requests while keeping the
LoonFS credential on the server.

Set `authorize` to check each request and set `Loonfs-Actor` on forwarded
requests. The proxy always removes the browser's actor header.
Here, `authorized_actor` checks the application's session and namespace access.

```python
from loonfs.proxy import LoonFSProxy, ProxyAuthorization, ProxyRefusal

async def authorize(scope, context):
    actor_id = await authorized_actor(scope, context.namespace_id)
    if actor_id is None:
        return ProxyRefusal(status=403)
    return ProxyAuthorization(actor_id=actor_id)

app = LoonFSProxy(
    os.environ["LOONFS_URL"],
    os.environ["LOONFS_AUTH_TOKEN"],
    {"team-files": "demo"},
    authorize=authorize,
)
```

See the [generated API reference](https://github.com/loonfs/loonfs-sdk-python/blob/main/reference.md).

## Retries

The SDK retries connection failures and responses that carry `Retry-After`,
and does not retry on status alone. It never retries operations that LoonFS
marks `not_idempotent`. Use the `max_retries` client or request option to
tune the retry count.

For publication retries, call `client.files.prepare(namespace_id,
content=payload)` once and retain its `PreparedFile`. Pass it to
`client.files.upload_prepared(namespace_id, path=path, prepared=prepared,
commit_id=commit_id, request_options={"additional_headers": {"Loonfs-Actor": actor_id}})` on each attempt, keeping all publication
inputs identical. Preparation does not create a visible file or extend the
upload lifetime. Calling `upload` again prepares the source again: it may create a
fresh upload or select a different representation if capabilities changed. Retain the prepared
value for retries, including inline content, and never switch representations
after a failed or uncertain commit.

## Generated code

This SDK is generated from the LoonFS OpenAPI specification. Please report SDK
