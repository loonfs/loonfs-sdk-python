# LoonFS Python SDK

One package for LoonFS server and proxy applications. SDK v0.1.x targets LoonFS
API v0.3.x.

## Install

```sh
pip install loonfs
```

Choose the module that matches where your code runs.

## Server

```python
import os

from loonfs.server import LoonFS

client = LoonFS(
    base_url=os.environ["LOONFS_URL"],
    token=os.environ["LOONFS_AUTH_TOKEN"],
)

capabilities = client.system.get_capabilities()
```

`AsyncLoonFS` provides the same API for async applications. Upload and download
helpers are available from `loonfs.transfers`.

## Proxy

Use `loonfs.proxy` in your backend to forward client requests while keeping the
LoonFS credential on the server.

See the [generated API reference](https://github.com/loonfs/loonfs-sdk-python/blob/main/reference.md).

## Retries

The SDK retries transient failures on operations that are safe to repeat.
Operations that LoonFS classifies as non-idempotent are never retried
automatically. Use the `max_retries` client or request option to tune retries for
safe operations.

## Generated code

This SDK is generated from the LoonFS OpenAPI specification. Please report SDK
issues in the [main LoonFS repository](https://github.com/loonfs/loonfs).
